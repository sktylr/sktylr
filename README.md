### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sam and I'm a second year computer science student studying in [Trinity College Dublin](https://tcd.ie).

My skills include:
* Java
* C
* Python
* Django framework
* REST API's

I'm currently learning Typescript and React and have plans to develop a financial organisation tool for personal use.

I started programming aged 11 when I attended an [Academy of Code](https://https://www.theacademyofcode.com/) summer camp. I was introduced to [processing](https://processing.org), a tool that helps beginners get a quicker grasp of programming, without the normal overheads requried in setting up a regular Java project.

I stayed with the Academy of Code for a further 18 months before stopping due to time constraints.

I am currently undertaking a Computer Science degree in Trinity College Dublin and am in my second year.

You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sktylr). Feel free to reach out, I'm always open to new opportunities.
