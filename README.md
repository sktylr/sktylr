### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sam and I'm a third year computer science student studying in [Trinity College Dublin](https://tcd.ie).

My skills include:
* Python
* TypeScript

* Django framework
* REST API's

I'm currently learning Typescript and React and am developing an expense tracking tool for personal use.

I have a strong interest in server-side development, particularly in the fintech space.
