### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sam and I'm a second year computer science student studying in [Trinity College Dublin](https://tcd.ie).

I have experience with Java and C and am developing my skills in other languages such as Python and Javascript currently.

I started programming aged 12 by attending an [Academy of Code](https://https://www.theacademyofcode.com/) summer camp. Here I learned [processing](https://processing.org), a Java based language that made animation and drawing to the screen easier to grasp. I continued with the Academy of Code by attending more camps and weekend classes over the next 18 months. Unfortunately, school and other commitments got in the way and I stopped going. However, I would dip back in on occassion and try to figure out what was happening in the code.

I maintained my interest in computer programming and computers in general, so out of school I applied to the Integrated Computer Science Program in Trinity College. Here, I resurrected my github profile. This profile hosts all of my college assignments and work, which for plagiarism purposes must be kept private. When time allows, I pursue my own projects as well and seek to expand my knowledge of frameworks and languages.

I'm currently working on a calculator and unit converting app alongside a web app to solve sudoku puzzles (and their more challenging cousins, killer sudoku).
